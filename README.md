# greenfoot-rubiks-cube
I typically use Greenfoot (https://www.greenfoot.org/) whenever I'm teaching teenagers to program. I want to show that Greenfoot can do "real" things and isn't just a "watered down" programming platform; I don't want them thinking there's some mystical difference between what I'm teaching them vs. "real" programming. So this is the project I show them.

All it does is render a cube and shuffle it randomly. You can use the arrow keys to rotate it.
