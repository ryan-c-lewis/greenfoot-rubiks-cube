# greenfoot-rubiks-cube
I often use Greenfoot (https://www.greenfoot.org/) when I'm teaching someone else how to code. I want to show that Greenfoot can do "real" things, so this is the project I show them.

All it does is render a cube and shuffle it randomly. You can use the arrow keys to rotate it.
